# Pink Trombone

This is a revised version of the Pink Trombone speech
synthesizer originally developed by Neil Thapen in 2017.
The original source code was modularized and converted to TypeScript.
Then the TypeScript code was converted to Rust.

Pink Trombone uses two-dimensional
[digital waveguide synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_waveguide_synthesis)
to synthesize human speech sounds.

# Sample code

You can easily connect Pink Trombone to any audio framework, that accepts
`f32` inputs.
